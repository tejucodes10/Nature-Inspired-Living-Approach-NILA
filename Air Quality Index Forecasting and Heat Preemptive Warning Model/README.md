# â›…Air Quality Index Forecasting and Heat Preemptive Warning Model

Our Time Series Forecasting module, employing LSTM technology, forecasts heatwaves and AQI in specified locations. 
With meticulous data preprocessing, seasonal decomposition, and rigorous training for 500 epochs, we achieved an impressive 97% accuracy.

## Objectives ðŸŒŸ
Time series forecasting for heatwaves in specified locations. \

## Steps: 
Data preprocessing (cleaning and handling missing data). 
Scaling for neural network compatibility. 
Seasonal decomposition to understand cyclic patterns.

## Model: 
Utilised LSTM for its ability to handle long sequences. 

## Training: 
Trained the model for 500 epochs. 

## We achieved 97% accuracy
