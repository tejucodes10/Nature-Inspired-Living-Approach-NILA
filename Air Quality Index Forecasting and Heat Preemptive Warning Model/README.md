# Advanced Time Series Forecasting for Urban Dynamics: A Comprehensive Approach

## Overview

In this project module, we leveraged data science to conduct a sophisticated analysis on urban dynamics using datasets sourced from naascom. Our focus was on five distinctive citiesâ€”Adilabad, Karimnagar, Khammam, Nizamabad, and Warangal. Through a meticulously crafted pipeline, we undertook a journey from data preprocessing to deploying cutting-edge models, resulting in accurate time series forecasting and temperature predictions for each city. A dashboard is then built based on the data. 

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Rigorous cleaning and handling of missing values.
   - Standardization of data formats to ensure integrity.

2. **Data Scaling:**
   - Utilized data scaling techniques to enhance model performance.
   - Ensured each variable contributed equally to prevent bias.

3. **Seasonal Decomposition:**
   - Employed state-of-the-art techniques to dissect time series data.
   - Revealed underlying trends, seasonality, and residual components.

4. **Time Series Forecasting:**
   - Implemented LSTM models with 500 epochs for capturing intricate dependencies.
   - Achieved an impressive 95% accuracy in predicting future trends.

5. **Temperature Forecasting:**
   - Applied rigorous techniques to forecast temperatures for each city.
   - Enriched the depth of our analysis with climatic influences.

## Results

The outcome of our efforts is a predictive model that accurately captures the nuances of urban dynamics, providing valuable insights for each city. The temperature forecasting component further enriches the depth of our analysis, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the urban environment.

## Conclusion

Our project stands as a testament to the power of data-driven insights in unraveling the complexities of urban dynamics. By combining advanced techniques in data preprocessing, scaling, seasonal decomposition, and LSTM modeling, we have created a robust framework for forecasting trends in diverse urban landscapes.

**Note:** The impressive 95% accuracy achieved in time series forecasting underscores the efficacy of our approach.
