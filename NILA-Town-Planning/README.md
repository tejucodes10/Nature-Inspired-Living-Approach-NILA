# 🌍 Sustainable Town Planning Simulator 🏡

Welcome to the Sustainable Town Planning Simulator! This application, developed with Three.js, Vite, and React, aims to simulate town planning scenarios with a strong emphasis on achieving sustainability goals. The objective is to create a 3D cityscape where users can dynamically build buildings, industries, roads, and houses, considering environmental impact and sustainability.

## Getting Started 🚀

To run the simulator, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Clone this repository and navigate to the root directory.
3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
## Simulator Features 🌱

- **3D City Rendering:** Utilizing Three.js for a visually immersive and sustainable experience.
- **Population Dynamics:** Witness dynamic changes in the city as the population grows sustainably.
- **Sustainable Asset Library:** Access a library of eco-friendly assets, categorized by their impact on Air Quality Index (AQI) factors.
- **Smart Simulation Loop:** Dynamically build and modify the city based on sustainable practices, considering different building categories and their contribution to AQI.
- **Environmental Impact:** Visualize and manage the environmental impact, minimizing pollution, and promoting green spaces.

## Sustainable Town Planning Strategies 🏡

Town planning officials can use this simulator to implement sustainable practices:

- Plan locations of eco-friendly buildings, renewable energy sources, and green spaces strategically.
- Categorize buildings based on their impact on AQI factors, considering factors such as emissions and pollutants.
- Avoid placing schools and hospitals near high-impact industries to minimize pollution exposure.
- Implement measures to control pollution based on sustainable population growth.
- Simulate and assess real-time ML-driven models for proactive decision-making toward sustainability.

## Future Work for Sustainable Urban Development 🚧

Future enhancements include:

- Suggestions for sustainable measures based on population changes and building categories.
- Real-time alerts for officials through ML-driven models focused on sustainability and AQI.
- Comprehensive planning strategies aligned with global sustainability goals.
